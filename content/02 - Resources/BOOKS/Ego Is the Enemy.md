## Highlights
I’ve found that if you go looking you’ll find that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition

Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned

---
ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.

---
suppress ego early before bad habits take hold,

---
The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance

---
If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity

In this way, ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft.
