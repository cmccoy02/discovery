## Highlights
habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically

---
YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU

---
1% BETTER EVERY DAY
			1% worse every day for one year.  0.99365 = 00.03
			1% better every day for one year.  1.01365 = 37.78

---
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe

---
Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

---
the aggregation of marginal gains

---
FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

---
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change

---
changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years

---
wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict

---
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

---
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs

---
The human brain is a prediction machine

---
You are much more than your conscious self.

---
The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.

---
Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

---
Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why

---
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior

---
Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

---
If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.

---
You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.

---
The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often

---
We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.

---
Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.

---
Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

---
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.

---
Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices.

---
Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.

---
A craving
